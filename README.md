This plug-in is used to render the visual studio code monaco editor in APEX. You can load source code as clob and the same or another source code as diff. The plug-in is also able to store the edited code back into the database e.g. in an APEX Collection as clob.

You can set different languages, theme styles and many more.

Many thanks to Tobias Arnhold (https://twitter.com/tobias_arnhold) for testing and the idea!

Examples can be found in the Sample App:

The Code is also running without APEX. For test just start index.html!
