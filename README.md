# APEX-Monaco-Editor-and-Diff-Viewer
This Oracle APEX plug-in is used to render the visual studio monaco code editor in APEX. You can load source code as clob and the same or another source code as diff. The plug-in is also able to store the edited code back into the database e.g. in an APEX Collection as clob.
